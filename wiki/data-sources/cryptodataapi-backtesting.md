CryptoDataAPI's Backtesting section is the historical arm of the API: a full archive of OHLCV klines, funding rates, and liquidation records, plus dated point-in-time daily snapshots and downloadable Parquet archives reaching back to 2020. It exists so that research uses the data as it stood on each historical date — the [[point-in-time-data]] discipline that keeps [[lookahead-bias]] out of strategy results.

Historical depth: Parquet archive from 2020.

## Live Data

Only `/backtesting/status` is about the present — it reports collector health so you know whether the archive is up to date. `/backtesting/symbols`, `/backtesting/snapshots`, and `/backtesting/archives-index` are discovery endpoints listing what is currently available to query or download.

## Historical Data

Everything else is history. `/backtesting/klines`, `/backtesting/funding`, and `/backtesting/liquidations` query the full archive directly; `/backtesting/export` pulls a custom range; `/backtesting/archives` + `/backtesting/archives/download` hand out pre-signed URLs for bulk Parquet datasets going back to 2020. The point-in-time core is `/backtesting/daily-snapshots/{date}`: the API's state frozen as of that day, so a backtest on 2023-03-15 sees exactly what a live system saw on 2023-03-15. Regime-probability history lives separately under the Pro Plus quant endpoints on [[cryptodataapi-regimes]].

## Trading Applications

- **Bias-free research** — dated daily snapshots enforce [[point-in-time-data]] and eliminate [[lookahead-bias]], the foundation of any credible [[backtesting]] workflow (see [[backtesting-overview]])
- **Perp strategy backtests** — historical funding and liquidation records address the funding-payment and liquidation-cascade issues catalogued in [[crypto-perp-backtesting-pitfalls]]
- **Hyperliquid replay** — combine archived klines and funding with live schema from [[cryptodataapi-hyperliquid]] for [[hyperliquid-backtesting]] with matching production data shapes
- **Bulk quantitative research** — Parquet archives since 2020 load straight into pandas/DuckDB for vectorised multi-year studies without pagination
- **Survivorship checks** — `/backtesting/symbols` plus dated snapshots reveal what was actually tradeable on each date, keeping delisted assets in the test universe

## Example

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: $CDA_KEY" "https://cryptodataapi.com/api/v1/backtesting/daily-snapshots/2024-01-15"
