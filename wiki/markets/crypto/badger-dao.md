## Trading Profile

### Venues & liquidity

BADGER is a **PERP-FIRST** asset: it trades as **BADGER-PERP on Hyperliquid** (up to ~40-50x leverage) but is **not listed on Binance**, and spot access is limited to a handful of offshore/DeFi venues (Kraken spot, plus Uniswap/Balancer/Sushiswap DEX pools). As a result, price discovery and directional flow concentrate on the Hyperliquid perp rather than on fragmented, thin spot books. Practical implications:

- **Depth is shallow.** With a small market cap and ~$1M daily spot turnover, the HL order book is thin; large orders move price, so size positions modestly and favor limit/passive fills over market orders.
- **Execution is venue-concentrated.** Because there is no deep CEX spot leg, cross-venue hedging is awkward and true cash-and-carry requires the offshore/DEX spot leg — factor borrow/withdrawal frictions into any carry structure.
- **High leverage amplifies risk.** 40-50x on a thin book means small moves can trigger liquidations; keep effective leverage well below the cap.

### Applicable strategies

- [[funding-rate-harvest]] — on a low-liquidity perp-first alt, funding can run persistently positive/negative; collect the carry while delta-hedging where a spot leg is feasible.
- [[crowded-long-funding-fade]] — thin OI and retail chasing on the HL perp can push funding to extremes; fade over-crowded longs when funding spikes.
- [[liquidation-cascade-fade]] — high leverage on a shallow book produces sharp liquidation wicks; fade the overshoot after forced-selling exhausts.
- [[post-liquidation-rebound]] — after a cascade flushes leveraged positions on BADGER-PERP, the snap-back is often outsized given how few resting bids exist.
- [[oi-price-exhaustion]] — with concentrated flow on one venue, rising OI into a stalling price is a clean exhaustion signal on this perp.
- [[range-mean-reversion]] — outside of narrative spikes BADGER tends to grind in ranges near cycle lows; fade the band edges with tight risk.

### Volatility & regime character

BADGER is a **small-cap DeFi / infrastructure token** (a BTC-in-DeFi / yield-aggregator governance token) trading at a deep drawdown from its ATH. It behaves as a **high-beta altcoin**: it is largely correlated to BTC/ETH risk-on/risk-off swings but with amplified moves, and it can decouple sharply on DeFi-sector narratives or protocol-specific news. Realized volatility is elevated and reflexive because thin liquidity magnifies both rallies and flushes.

### Risk flags

- **Liquidity & venue concentration** — flow is concentrated on a single perp venue (Hyperliquid); a listing/delisting or an HL outage would strand positions.
- **Thin spot / limited CEX access** — no Binance listing means weaker price discovery and harder hedging; slippage risk is high.
- **Narrative dependence** — as a DeFi-sector token far below ATH, price is sensitive to broad DeFi sentiment and protocol news.
- **Perp funding dislocations** — low OI can produce erratic, spiky funding on the HL perp; monitor before holding carry.
- **Emissions/governance** — capped near 21M supply with a high MC/FDV ratio limits dilution, but treasury/governance actions can still shift supply dynamics.
